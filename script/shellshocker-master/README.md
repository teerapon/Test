If you don't know what the ShellShock Bash exploit is, you should probably Google it.
Now that you know...

### What is this for?
ShellShocker tests a website for vulnerability to the ShellShock bug.
There's a command-line tool for doing testing, and a deployable Flask-powered
ShellShock testing website (punch in the URL of your server, we'll tell you
what's vulnerable)
It can act as a testing toolkit for ShellShock for researchers as well!

### How do I use it?
We'll have a Heroku deployment soon.
***Documentation coming soon***
